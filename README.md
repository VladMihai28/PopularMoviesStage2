This is my solution for the PopularMoviesStage2 project part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program.

This app uses the Movie Database API in order to get information.
In order to run it please add your own API key in a variable called MyMovieDBApiKey located in the gradle.properties file.
The code should look like this:
...
MyMovieDBApiKey="Your API Key"
...
